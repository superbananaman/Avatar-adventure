	This is a 3rd person, isometric player based game.
	You can pick up and drop items, and use keys to go through doors into new dungeon rooms.
	To play the game, you first have to run a server.

Running a Server-
	A server requires a port number and the number of clients in the game.
	There is a load filename option to load a save file.
	Once the server is running you can run a client.

Running a Client-
	A client requires an IP Address of the computer that is running the server.
	It also needs the port number that the server is run on and a name for your character.
		-If either a port or an IP address is not given, will default to port 14143 on local host
	Until the required number of clients join the server you will wait in a lobby where you can chat with other people who have joined
	Once the required number of clients has joined the server, the game will begin.

	The object of the game is to collect keys to open doors to get to the boss and kill it.
	To pick up objects press 'p'. To drop items press 'o'. To go through doors, assuming you have
	the key, press 'space'.
	To attack enemies, stand on them and press 'k', but be careful not to die!
